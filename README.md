# Enhancing-Simulated-Annealing-for-Complex-Optimization-Problems-

## Project Overview
The project is part of the Computer Programming course at Bocconi University. The project includes Python code and analysis of the results, which are documented in the report.
The main objective is to implement the Simulated Annealing algorithm, analyzing its behaviour under different configurations and evauating its ability to avoid local minima and find the global minima.

## Files
* `Individual_project.py`: Main script file, it contains the implementation of the algorithm
* `Generate_data.py`: Script used to generate data for the simulation
* Ã¬ndividual_project.pdf`: The project report, it includes results and detailed analysis.
